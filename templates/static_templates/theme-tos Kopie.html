<h2>${_("Comment on these Terms of Use")}</h2>

By using and participating in this site, you signify that you have read these terms and agree to be bound by and comply with them. If you do not agree to be bound by these terms, please promptly exit openeurship.com.

<h2>${_("Preface")}</h2>
<p>${_("Openeurship.com is an internet based platform run by ZIfET (Central Institute for Scientific Entrepreneurship and International Transfer), for the use of the so called Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC), serving the need of the Koblenz and Landau Entrepreneurial University. The Platform aims primarily at students who would like to enroll in courses of universities other than their actual course of study. But also anybody else interested in further academic studies can join the Platform\'s courses as a user. ZIfET therefore caters to the need of communication between teachers and students and provides to this end the Openeurship Platform. Due to its academic environment, Openeurship aims to keep a healthy balance between the free flow of information and intellectual property rights, keeping the best interests of its Users in mind. ZIfET is aware that the Users of the Platform expect all personal data conveyed to Openeurship to be handled with utmost care. Our basic principle: The User has complete control over the content posted by him or her (such as files, discussions, links, etc.). ZIfET will use the data provided by its Users solely for the purpose of providing a reliable and useful service. ZIfET expects its Users to display the same level of care in dealing with the personal and intellectual property rights of other Users and rights holders. To ensure a productive and safe work environment, it is indispensable to adhere to some general principles. By registering for the Openeurship platform the User agrees to accept the validity of and ensure compliance with these terms of use. ")}</p>

<h2>${_("Disclaimer")}</h2>
<p>${_("A gender-sensitive language is one of the basic communication principles at Openeurship. However, when it comes to official wording and legal terminology this is unfortunately not always possible. We therefore apologize for instances of failing to fully adhere to the standards of gender-sensitive writing in the following terms of use. Of course, we continue to do our best wherever we can to write and speak in a gender-sensitive manner. Sites may include unmoderated forums containing the personal opinions and other expressions of the persons who post entries on a wide range of topics. Neither the content of these Sites, nor the links to other web sites, are screened, approved, reviewed or endorsed by ZIfET. ZIfET is also not a publisher of any of the content of the Sites, or of any content that may be available through links to and from them, and is acting solely as an internet service provider. The text and other material on these Sites are the opinion of the specific authors and are not statements of advice, opinion, or information of ZIfET. If you feel you might be offended by the content of this site, you should not continue.")}</p>
